# On Books and Reading

## Why Books Are Still Relevant

I spent so much of my childhood and early adulthood reading, before the web became omnipresent, but I got back into reading books - in a serious way - about 5 years ago.

Since then, I have read dozens and dozens of books, and they really have enriched my whole life, not just my career.

It is impossible to get an expert understanding of almost any subject without reading at least a few good books about it.

Contrary to what you might think, books never have gone away in the digital age, just our patience, concentration span, and capacity to learn their contents.

Even the most popular and insightful online articles on a new idea are frequently based on third-hand interpretations of the leading research papers and books on the particular subject.

I prefer physical books because it is good idea to get away from the screen, but I also have a Kindle, a Kobo e-reader and a small tablet with e-reader apps for colour comics/graphic novels.

There is so much untapped wisdom, knowledge and entertainment in books, and if you are overlooking the importance of reading, you really are missing out.

Reading books in your spare time improves the speed of which you can read online content too, so if you spend your work days reading online webpages, then the more practice you have, the faster and more accurately you can read, and if you practice note-taking too, the better your notes.

They also improve your ability to write, communicate, reduce your stress levels (if you read fiction), and improve your imagination and vocabulary.

Not to mention that women love books, a high percentage of book readers are female, so if you are a single man, I would say it is seen as a desirable characteristic, and quite a rare one these days!

## Make Notes

When reading non-fiction (or complex fiction), make notes on books. Underline, highlight, write in the margins, make online notes.. the more notes you make, the better your understanding will be of what you're reading.

My dad who worked as a university lecturer and is officially a 'super smart person', and who has read books voraciously throughout his life, recommends putting an A5 sheet of paper with a handwritten summary of the previous chapter in the book at the end of each chapter. That way you can quickly go back years later and get the understanding that you had when reading the book fresh the first time.

## Read Selectively

With non-fiction you usually don't have to read the WHOLE book to get a good idea of its contents. Remember being in university and given a 20 book reading list for every course? Did anyone expect you to read ALL of those books cover-to-cover? Of course not, that wasn't even possible.

Read selectively and combine scanning through a text with detailed reading of parts, and making notes.

If you never went to university, or it has been a while since you did some proper study-type reading, there are books on that!

Personally I recommend the Open University Humanities Study Guide as an excellent and approachable reference to the different styles of reading you can do, and how to make good notes. There is also the Open University STEM Study Guide but I find the Humanities one has better reading and note-taking advice which is applicable to all reading, but it is worth picking both up.

## Getting Books for Cheap

You don't have to buy all your physical books new!! Often you can get a huge discount by buying them second-hand, via Amazon or elsewhere. Some popular books, such as university textbooks and classic literature, can be bought for only Â£2, and the quality is good! A lot of ebooks can be found online for free. Imagine that kind of value for money, either in entertainment time, or amount learned, occurring anywhere else in this modern world?!

## Bookshops and Libraries

I love bookshops and libraries.

Libraries are fast becoming a thing of the past in the UK, sadly, with very old books on the shelves and very little funding for new books. However if you find a good one, the books are free! A lot of libraries these days also have online ebook collections which you can 'borrow' in the same way as physical books - i.e. for free.

Bookshops are just great to soak in the excitement and enthusiasm of new books, particularly fiction, to read books before you buy them, and to sniff that wonderful 'new book' smell without even having to buy a new book!

## Write and Read Reviews

Finally, I really recommend writing reviews of your books and reading others reviews, as a way of discovering more books, sharing your experiences, and summarising what you've learned.

Goodreads.com is my favourite review site, it's one of the most extensive.

## Summary

To paraphrase George R. R. Martin - "That's what I do. I read books, and I know things."

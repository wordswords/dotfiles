# Skills Needed to Sustainably Excel as a Software Engineer

It is my experience that the knowledge and skills you will need as a software engineer who is an individual technical contributor, can be categorised in these areas:

- Personal Efficiency and Productivity
- Technical Knowledge
- Business and Domain Knowledge
- People Skills and Communication Skills

## Personal Efficiency and Productivity

It is a sad fact of software development that, more often than not, you will be judged on your speed of completing development features, not the quality of the code you produce, or the long term effect on the product it will have.

So you have got to work on your productivity and efficiency in your job role, because of two things:

- You need to be able to develop and ship code fast in most software organisations anyway.
- You need to be able to develop and ship code FASTER than the normal expectations, because you will (as a responsible and knowledgable software engineer) take extra time to make sure the quality of your contributions is as high as you can get it NO MATTER WHAT pressures project management will put you under.

Lots of lazy software developers go down the 'short cut' route of just getting features developed as fast as possible. This can get them far, but it is a fundamentally unethical and ignorant approach, contrary to the craft of technical excellence you should be pursuing as a software developer, and the beneficial long-term effects it has on software products.

To improve technical efficiency/productivity there are many skills you can improve, including:

- Knowing your own personal software development environment inside out, and making it as efficient for you as possible.
- Eating well, sleeping well, exercising well, keeping good physical health, optimising for a sedentary job where you will need to be at your most mentally alert for the rest of your career.
- Working on resilience and your mental health to a level where you can consistently and sustainably deliver.
- Find a strong drive and self-motivation to do what you do. This doesn't necessarily have to come from the job itself, it can come from the pressures of supporting a large family, for example.
- Work on self-discipline.
- Practising code katas, so you are familiar with your chosen technology stacks and languages and implementing solutions fast.
- Make sure you don't waste time during the day and work hard and efficiently for your contracted work hours, and don't do overtime, and then take time to RELAX after work. Overtime is unsustainable and is the sign of a bad organisation.

Some efficiency skills will also be covered under 'people skills' and 'technical knowledge'. If you have good people skills and good relationships in your organisation, then it is much easier to get things done quicker. If you have great technical knowledge and experience, you will implement things faster and more accurately.

## Technical Knowledge

Some people would say that the other categories are more important than technical knowledge. It is undoubtedly true that you will encounter many people in your software engineering career who excel at the other categories and are not strong in their technical knowledge. They often occupy the highest ranks in an organisation and are paid the highest.

But it's not all about money or ladder-climbing. I would say, software engineers first and foremost need to be technical specialists and experts. Of course the other areas are important, but if software engineers are not the technical experts in modern day society, who exactly is supposed to be?

- Learn how to teach yourself anything (or nearly anything). This is the most important skill you can have a knowledge worker. Read books on learning how to learn, develop an effective note-taking and knowledge retention strategy, and implement what you have learned in personal projects and your career.
- Read a lot of technical books. More or less ALL the most important ideas in software engineering, computer science and many other subjects have been concentrated and expressed the best in books. It takes a substantial amount of effort to write a book, and the market is very competitive, and they are peer reviewed heavily, by experts, so the standards are very high. Most books out there are simply not worth your time, but the 5% that are, represent an incredibly good value way of learning the absolute best thinking out there, in your career.
- Study relevant theoretical academic subjects such as Computer Science, Electronic Engineering, Maths and Artificial Intelligence. Having a good educational foundation in these subjects is invaluable, although very difficult to get. Even if you had no formal education, you can make up for it by reading the right books on the subject, and practising what you've learned.
- Personal/toy projects are invaluable in implementing and assimilating the theoretical knowledge that you have read. If you don't have a personal project that you spend your spare time doing, get one now. It is very important to find something that you love that will also teach you a lot about your skill set. Always have a side-project going throughout your career, not focused on making money necessarily, but just having fun developing software and improving your technical skills. Make sure it is fun and keeps on being fun.
- Try teaching or mentoring as a way to improve your own knowledge and improve your communication and people skills. The best way to become an expert at something is to learn to teach it, because if you strive to do it well, you will become painfully aware of how little you know, and how much there is to know.

## Business and Domain Knowledge

It is a fact of working for an organisation or business, that the more you understand about the business and its objectives, and the more you contribute to those objectives, the better you will do at that organisation.

Someone who writes a 3 line badly written batch file that solves a critical problem that business has, will be a hero, whereas the developer spending a long time and a lot of effort crafting a brilliant technical solution for a problem that the business does not value, will not do well in the organisation.

This area also covers the knowledge of how the business works and how and why the software systems it uses are set up to meet those needs.

I often think that as software engineers, we are often not given access to the meetings and learn the decisions that determine a lot of the business objectives and practices, and we are not sufficiently educated, especially in large organisations, how we can add the best value to the business, which may sometimes not be included in, or even run counter to, what we are told to do by our immediate management!

A lot of engineer types shy away from the business knowledge and are uninterested in developing their knowledge and domain knowledge. They just want to be told what to do. That is fine, but it will reduce the impact you can have on the success of the business, and how people will see you in that particular organisation. It will also reduce the autonomy and freedom you are given.

## People and Communication Skills

People and communication skills are going to be key to your career and your effectiveness within it. Gone are the days when an anti-social engineer was locked in a basement for years and eventually emerges with a brilliant technical solution that changes the world.

I know that often engineers would prefer that was the case, but it is questionable whether that was ever really the case, or was just imagined or stereotyped as such.

Even in academia and research on the cutting edge technical problems of our time, your people skills will make you much more effective. What makes professors effective? It is the combination of their technical knowledge and research, BUT ALSO their ability to communicate it and teach it. Not to mention the extremely competitive and often nepotistic cut-throat academic arena demands good people skills to succeed in.

It might be possible to progress with bad people skills, but it's going to be 100x as difficult. And overwhelmingly the statistical chances are, if you are reading this, then you are not good enough technically to succeed with bad people skills.

If you want to get a job and get paid, focus on acquiring skills that are 1) in demand and 2) under supply.

Everyone knows JavaScript. So don't spend ages specialising in JavaScript, even if you love the language, because the supply of JavaScript developers is such that it is not a good return on investment.

Learn tech skills that people find difficult, so there are higher barriers to entry to acquiring them, but also pick skills that there is high demand for.

Learn tech skills that people find unpopular or 'uncool' but there is high demand. A small number of people make a lot of money as Fortran contractors, believe it or not.

Look at skills shortage lists. Look at lists that show the most 'in demand' areas where employers are struggling to find skilled candidates, such as cyber security, machine learning, test automation, devops/MLOps .. and so on.

This is basic economic supply and demand theory, and is true today as it was when I learned it in high school over 20 years ago.

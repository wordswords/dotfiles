A lot of tech companies will leave vacancies 'open' for hiring for months and months.

Hundreds of people will apply, and go through the application process, only to be turned down and no hire is made.

Why is this? Because these tech companies are kidding themselves.

If you have hundreds of applicants and you interview, say, 50, then in this market, you are bound to have already found someone who is good enough for the role.

They think that with the method they're using they're getting the 'cream of the crop'. The 'needle in the haystack'. They are just kidding themselves that they can differentiate such minutate that seperates hundreds of applicants that meet the required skillset from a hire.

When there are that many applicants, the hiring teams 'unconcious biases' kick in. They turn applicants down for 'spider sense' things which are mere imaginary slights and nothing to do with the skillsets they require. This is not helpful for a diverse and healthy team. Face it: you do not have a spider sense, you have an unconcious bias.

You are going to make hiring mistakes that you won't even know about until 6-12 months down the line. This is reality. This is normal. There is nothing you can do about it except pick the best candidate at the time and see if it both works out for both parties.

Meanwhile, the software team is understaffed and having to work 120% because of this silly recruitment game, and more engineers are likely to quit.

And people who are applying are getting frustrated when they're seeing the same role readvertised after they apply.

Face it, you are looking for something that doesn't exist. You are looking for the mythical 'unicorn' developer, when what you need to do is to simply hire from the very decent candidate pool that you have available already.

Don't kid yourselves.

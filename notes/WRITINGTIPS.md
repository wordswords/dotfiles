* Try not to start successive sentences or paragraphs with the same word. It makes people tune out.
* Use the spelling checker and grammar checker on each piece.
* Use proper spacing. Too dense a paragraph will put people off, too light may
seem overtly spamming.
* Be mindful on social media of the visible element before the user clicks on
the 'show me more' button. Try and write this part as a compelling hook.
* Posts with interesting pictures or other visible content get a lot more
attention.
* Don't be wordy, be succinct. The fewer words the better.
* Try not to repeat words in sentences. The more you repeat words, the more people
are likely to switch off.
* If you can say something in simpler language, do so. Not everyone has a
thesaurus to hand.
* Adapt your writing to your audience. You should use different language
depending on who you are writing for. Literate and educated professionals may
understand and appreciate a philosophical take on an issue, whereas the
public might not, and think it is unnecessary.
* Adapt your writing to the platform. Social media post writing is very
different from writing for a journal, for example, in terms of format and what
you can say.
* On social media, take into account the overall public opinion for the topic
you're writing about. Is it a good idea to publicly publish a hot take on the
Queen's role in society when everyone else is posting about how much they loved
her?
* Make images associated with social media posts twice as wide as they are high.
The social media platforms display these better.
* Prefer images in your post to be bright colours, it will be more popular.
* If you ARE going to repeat a word, do it on purpose to make a point.
* If you are passionate/interested in the subject you're writing about, readers
are more likely to find your work interesting.
* If you are writing on a controversial subject, you need to outline both sides!
And try and put yourself in the position not to offend people.

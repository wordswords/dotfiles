* Try not to start sentences with the same word. It makes people tune out.
* Use the spelling checker and grammar checker on each piece.
* Use proper spacing. Too dense a paragraph will put people off, too light may
seem overtly spamming.
* Be mindful on social media of the visible element before the user clicks on
the 'show me more' button. Try and write this part as a compelling hook.
* Posts with interesting pictures or other visible content get a lot more
attention.

Here is how I do meetings.

## Do we need a meeting?
* Never, ever, have a meeting that can be fully resolved via a Slack conversation or an email.

## Before the meeting:
* In the meeting invite briefly describe the problem and why it matters so people can decide whether to get involved and how to prioritise it.
* Set a time where everyone can make it. Never exclude anyone who wants to join.
* You may need to reach out to particular key people and convince them that the topic needs discussion in the first place, and that they need to be there.

## During the meeting:
* Keep each meeting as brief as possible.
* Introduce the problem and recap why we are discussing it, and why it matters.
* Come up with a list of possible solutions to the problem.
* Jointly decide on a solution that people generally agree with.
* Ask if anyone has any thing else to add.
* Convert the chosen solution into action points.
* Have those action points assigned to different people, ideally through volunteering.
* Repeat the action points and who is going to do what before ending the meeting. Often this involves taking notes on what the action points are, and/or creating items that will be project-managed, such as JIRA tickets.
* End the meeting positively by expressing happiness that the problem is on the way to be resolved, and by thanking everyone there.

Don't feel shy about taking the lead in meetings where there is no obvious
other leader.

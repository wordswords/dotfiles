Here is how I do meetings.

## Do we need a meeting?
* Never, ever, have a meeting that can be fully resolved via a Slack conversation or an email.

## Before the meeting:
* In the meeting invite briefly describe the problem and why it matters so people can decide whether to get involved and how to prioritise it.
* Set a time where everyone can make it. Never exclude anyone who wants to join.
* You may need to reach out to particular key people and convince them that the topic needs discussion in the first place, and that they need to be there.

## During the meeting:
1. Keep each meeting as brief as possible.
2. Introduce the problem and recap why we are discussing it, and why it matters.
3. Come up with a list of possible solutions to the problem.
4. Jointly decide on a solution that people generally agree with.
5. Ask if anyone has any thing else to add.
6. Convert the chosen solution into action points.
7. Have those action points assigned to different people, ideally through volunteering.
8. Repeat the action points and who is going to do what before ending the meeting. Often this involves taking notes on what the action points are, and/or creating items that will be project-managed, such as JIRA tickets.
9. End the meeting positively by expressing happiness that the problem is on the way to be resolved, and by thanking everyone there.

## Discussion in the meeting
* Don't feel shy about taking the lead in meetings where there is no obvious other leader.
* The responsibility of whoever is leading the meeting is to guide the discussion to ultimately a solution of the problem, with action points. If you end a meeting without a solution and action points, you need another meeting. You want to really avoid this.
* Keep the conversation positive and respectful while not shying away from directly stating your point, even if it is a difficult point.
* When disagreements come up, try and be as objective as possible and debate the facts, independently from the person that you are disagreeing with.
* Not everyone has to agree with the final solution, including you. That is normal. But don't plunge ahead and gloss over major problems with the solution that you might not have previously considered.
* Let everyone contribute, valid points can come from anywhere and anyone, regardless of seniority, whether you agree with them, your personal feelings, your experience with the person, or your presumptions about them.
* Avoid going round and round in circles. If two people are having a disagreement and are simply restating points at each other, again and again, ask what other people think about their points, to reach a decision.
* People should be allowed to get on with other work while listening in to the meeting. They should keep listening so they have an overview of what is happening and that if their opinion is requested, they can give it.
* If lots of people are tuning out and getting on with other work, it is a sign that the meeting shouldn't have taken place in the first place, or at least those people tuning out shouldn't have been on the invite.
